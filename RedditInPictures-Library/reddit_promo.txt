For the last two weeks I've been working on a new Android application in my spare time, an image browser for Reddit that I'm calling [Reddit In Pictures](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antew.redditinpictures) (Market)

The main features:

* Browse any subreddit
* Swipe between images to go backwards or forwards (new images are loaded automatically)
* Ads can be disabled.
* Toggle Nsfw images on/off
* Supports decoding Imgur URLs and albums
* Sort by age and category (Hot, Top - All Time, etc)
* View a post summary with title, upvotes, subreddit, comments, submitter
* Pinch-to-zoom on any image
* View animated Gifs
* Share posts with other apps
* View the full post on the Reddit Mobile site (or open it in another Reddit mobile app)
* Images are cached to avoid repeated downloads, available cache size will vary by device.

I am trying something new with this app i'm calling "RateWare".  Ads can be disabled at any time via the settings menu, in exchange for disabling ads I ask that users rate the app in the Google Play Store.  It works on the honor system, you don't have to e-mail me for a key, all I'm really looking for here is more ratings and more reviews - whether they be positive or negative.

I tried to find other examples of RateWare on the market, but I was unsuccessful, if anyone has encountered other examples I'd love to hear of them.

I'm releasing the free version with the features above, and later a Pro version that includes additional features like:

* Logging in
* Loading subscribed reddits
* Upvoting and downvoting posts
* Saving posts
* Saving images

It will be a bit of a hybrid between freemium and ad supported apps.
